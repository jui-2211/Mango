# .NET Core Microservices - The Complete Guide (.NET 8)

## Repository Overview

In this repository, you will find the foundational elements of Microservices by progressively building a real-world Microservices-based application with .NET 8. The step-by-step approach includes constructing multiple Microservices, and for authentication and authorization, .NET Identity will be employed.

### Topics Covered

- Build Microservices using .NET API, Ocelot, .NET Identity, Entity Framework Core, and clean architecture using the latest .NET 8.
- Develop e-commerce modules such as Product, Shopping Cart, Ordering, Payment, and Email Microservices with SQL Server communication over Azure Service Bus, and utilizing Ocelot API Gateway.
- Learn about Microservices Architecture and Step-by-Step Implementation in .NET.

### Microservices and Items Developed

- Product Microservice
- .NET Identity Microservice
- Coupon Microservice
- Shopping Cart Microservice
- Order Microservice
- Email Microservice
- Payment Microservice
- Ocelot Gateway Project
- MVC Web Application

### Additional Concepts

- .NET API with Authentication and Authorization
- Role-based authorization with .NET Identity
- Async and Sync communication between Microservices
- Azure Service Bus - Topics and Queues
- Gateways in Microservices
- Implementing Ocelot gateway
- Swagger Open API implementation
- N-Layer implementation with Repository Pattern
- ASP.NET Core Web Application with Bootstrap 5
- Entity Framework Core with SQL Server Database

## Is This Repository for You?

This repository is designed for developers who enjoy hands-on programming. The emphasis is on practical learning, with approximately 90% of the lessons involving active coding along with the instructor on the project. If you like coding from scratch and understanding the basics, this repository is a perfect fit.

By the end of your exploration of this repository, you will have worked on an application comprising 7 fully working .NET-based Microservices. More importantly, you will understand every line of code, how the Microservices work together, and why the final implementation was chosen.
