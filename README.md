# .NET Core Microservices - The Complete Guide (.NET 8)
## Repository Overview

In this repository, you will find the foundational elements of Microservices by progressively building a real-world Microservices-based application with .NET 8. The step-by-step approach includes constructing multiple Microservices, and for authentication and authorization, .NET Identity will be employed.

### Topics Covered

- Build Microservices using .NET API, Ocelot, .NET Identity, Entity Framework Core, and clean architecture using the latest .NET 8.
- Develop e-commerce modules such as Product, Shopping Cart, Ordering, Payment, and Email Microservices with SQL Server communication over Azure Service Bus, and utilizing Ocelot API Gateway.
- Learn about Microservices Architecture and Step-by-Step Implementation in .NET.
